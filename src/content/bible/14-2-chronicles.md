# 2 Chronicles  
*The God Who Revives and Restores His People*

> “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven... and heal their land.” — **2 Chronicles 7:14**

2 Chronicles continues the story of Israel’s kings, focusing on Judah — the southern kingdom — and God’s enduring presence in the temple.  
It’s a story of revival and decline, judgment and mercy, reminding us that every generation must choose humility, prayer, and obedience.

## Overview  
Beginning with Solomon’s reign, 2 Chronicles highlights the construction and dedication of the temple — the center of Israel’s worship.  
After Solomon’s death, the kingdom divides, and the narrative follows the kings of Judah (David’s descendants).  
Some bring revival and blessing; others lead the nation into idolatry.  
Through it all, God sends prophets to call His people back, showing His mercy even as judgment approaches.

## Author  
Traditionally attributed to **Ezra the priest**, the same author as 1 Chronicles.  
He wrote to encourage the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon, reminding them that God restores those who seek Him.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **450–430 BC**, covering events from **Solomon’s reign (970 BC)** to **Judah’s exile (586 BC)**.  
It concludes with Cyrus of Persia allowing the exiles to return and rebuild the temple.

## Audience  
Written for the **returning exiles**, reminding them of their spiritual roots and calling them to rebuild their nation on worship and obedience.  
For believers today, it’s a call to personal and corporate revival — to seek God’s presence again.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
By the time of writing, Judah had experienced exile in Babylon and was returning to a ruined land.  
Surrounded by foreign influence and temptation, they needed to remember how their ancestors’ disobedience led to loss — and how repentance led to renewal.  
2 Chronicles was their reminder that **God never abandons a repentant people**.

---

## Purpose  
- To emphasize God’s desire for repentance and restoration  
- To remind Judah of the blessings of obedience and the cost of idolatry  
- To show that worship is central to spiritual renewal  
- To encourage the exiles: God still fulfills His promises

## Genre
