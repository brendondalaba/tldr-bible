# Song of Solomon  
*The God Who Delights in Covenant Love*

> “I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine.” — **Song of Solomon 6:3**

Song of Solomon (also called *Song of Songs*) is a poetic celebration of love between a bride and her groom.  
It honors romantic love as a gift from God — pure, passionate, and committed — while also symbolizing the deeper spiritual love between God and His people.

---

## Overview  
Written as a dialogue between a bride (the Shulammite woman) and her beloved (often seen as Solomon), this book paints love as something sacred and beautiful when expressed within the boundaries of commitment.  
On a spiritual level, it reflects Christ’s love for His Church — personal, faithful, and full of delight.  
It reminds us that love, when grounded in God, is not shameful but holy.

---

## Author  
Traditionally attributed to **King Solomon**, who wrote or compiled this poetic masterpiece early in his reign.  
Though Solomon is named, the focus is not on his kingship but on love itself — as God designed it.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **970–950 BC**, during Solomon’s early years as king, before his spiritual decline.

## Audience  
Originally written for **Israel**, teaching that love, marriage, and intimacy are gifts from God to be cherished, not corrupted.  
For believers today, it reflects both human love and divine love — reminding us that God desires intimacy and devotion from His people.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
In ancient Israel, marriage was viewed as a sacred covenant.  
Unlike pagan cultures that distorted love through lust and idolatry, the Song portrays love with purity, passion, and mutual honor.  
Its poetic imagery uses nature, fragrance, and beauty to express affection and admiration between two people under God’s blessing.

## Purpose  
- To celebrate romantic and marital love as a holy gift from God  
- To illustrate the beauty of covenant commitment  
- To portray God’s love for His people as passionate and faithful  
- To remind us that intimacy — emotional and spiritual — begins with devotion

## Genre  
**Hebrew love poetry**  
Rich in imagery and symbolism, the Song uses dialogue, metaphor, and emotion to reveal God’s heart for covenant relationship.
