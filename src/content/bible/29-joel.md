## Overview  
When a swarm of locusts devastates the land, Joel calls the people to see it as more than a natural disaster — it’s a warning from God to return to Him.  
He declares that repentance will bring restoration, and restoration will lead to revival.  
Joel’s message moves from despair to hope, from judgment to joy, and from emptiness to empowerment through the Spirit of God.

## Author  
**Joel**, son of Pethuel.  
Little is known about him personally, but his message carries timeless weight — calling God’s people to repentance, worship, and Spirit-led renewal.

---

## Era / Date  
Likely written around **835–800 BC**, possibly during the reign of young King Joash in Judah.  
It may have been one of the earliest prophetic books.

---

## Audience  
Written to the **people of Judah**, urging them to repent after a national disaster.  
For believers today, Joel’s message reminds us that personal and spiritual revival always begins with returning to God.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
In the ancient world, locust plagues meant total loss — crops, income, and survival.  
Joel uses this crisis to point to something deeper: a coming “Day of the Lord,” when God would judge sin but also bring renewal.  
He foretells a future time when God’s Spirit will be poured out on all flesh — fulfilled at Pentecost and continuing through the Church.

---

## Purpose  
- To call God’s people to repentance through a natural disaster  
- To reveal the “Day of the Lord” as both judgment and hope  
- To promise restoration and spiritual renewal  
- To foretell the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on all believers  

---

## Genre  
**Prophetic poetry and apocalyptic vision**  
Joel’s style is vivid and urgent — using imagery of locusts, fire, and harvest to reveal spiritual truths.
