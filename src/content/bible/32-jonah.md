## Overview  
God calls Jonah, a prophet from Israel, to go to **Nineveh**, the capital of Assyria — Israel’s enemy — and warn them of coming judgment.  
Instead of obeying, Jonah runs in the opposite direction.  
After a storm, a miraculous rescue, and time inside a great fish, Jonah finally obeys.  
Nineveh repents, and God shows mercy — but Jonah struggles with that mercy, revealing the tension between God’s compassion and our pride.  
This short book shows that God’s heart beats for all nations, not just His own people.

## Author  
Traditionally attributed to **Jonah son of Amittai**, a prophet from Gath-hepher in northern Israel (2 Kings 14:25).  
He likely wrote this account after the events took place to reveal what God taught him through them.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **760–750 BC**, during the reign of **Jeroboam II** in Israel — a time when Assyria was a growing threat.

---

## Audience  
Originally written to **Israel**, to remind them that God’s mercy extends beyond their borders.  
For readers today, Jonah challenges us to embrace God’s compassion for all people — even those we find difficult to love.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, a powerful and brutal empire known for violence and cruelty.  
Israel saw them as enemies deserving judgment, not grace.  
Jonah’s reluctance reflected that national hostility — yet God’s mercy breaks through boundaries, showing that His compassion extends to the repentant everywhere.
