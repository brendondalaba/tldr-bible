## Overview

False teachers were traveling from town to town, spreading ideas that denied Jesus’ divinity and humanity.

John writes to remind believers — represented here as a “chosen lady and her children” — to love one another, hold fast to sound teaching, and avoid supporting those who reject Christ’s truth.

It’s a short but powerful call to discernment rooted in genuine love.

## Author

**The Apostle John**, referred to here as “the elder,” likely writing from Ephesus near the end of his life.

## Era / Date

Written around **A.D. 85–95**, close in time to 1 John.

## Audience

Addressed to “the elect lady and her children” — possibly a specific Christian woman and her household, or a metaphor for a local church and its members.

For believers today, 2 John teaches how to remain loving without compromising truth.

## Historical / Cultural Context

In the first century, hospitality was a key way of supporting traveling teachers and preachers.

However, false teachers were taking advantage of this kindness to spread lies about Jesus.

John warns believers not to aid or endorse those who deny the true Gospel.

## Purpose
- To encourage believers to walk in both truth and love
- To warn against false teachers who deny Christ’s incarnation
- To remind the church to protect doctrinal purity
- To reinforce that love must be guided by truth


## Genre

**Pastoral warning and encouragement**
