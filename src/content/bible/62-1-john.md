## Overview

False teachers (early Gnostics) were spreading confusion — claiming to have special knowledge while denying Jesus’ true humanity and divinity.

John writes to expose deception and affirm that real believers are marked by faith in Christ, obedience to God, and genuine love for others.

It’s a letter full of tests and reassurance — how to *know* that your faith is real.

## Author

**The Apostle John**, one of Jesus’ closest disciples and author of the Gospel of John and Revelation.

He writes as a loving elder who had walked with Christ personally.

## Era / Date

Written around **A.D. 85–95**, near the end of John’s life, likely from **Ephesus**.

## Audience

Written to a network of early churches influenced by false teaching and struggling with assurance of salvation.

For believers today, 1 John grounds us in spiritual confidence — showing that God’s children are known by their truth, love, and obedience.

## Historical / Cultural Context

The early Church faced a rising false belief called **Gnosticism**, which denied that Jesus truly came in the flesh and separated “spiritual” knowledge from moral living.

John reminds believers that true Christianity is not about secret knowledge — it’s about relationship with a real Savior who lived, died, and rose again.

## Purpose
- To help believers know they have eternal life in Christ
- To expose false teachers and spiritual deception
- To emphasize that genuine faith produces obedience and love
- To strengthen fellowship with God and one another


## Genre

**Pastoral letter of assurance and correction**

Warm yet direct — John writes as both shepherd and watchman.
