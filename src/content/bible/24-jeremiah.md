## Overview  
Jeremiah served as God’s prophet during Judah’s final years before the Babylonian exile.  
He pleaded with the people to turn back to God, but they refused.  
As Jerusalem fell, Jeremiah watched with grief — yet through tears, he spoke of hope: God would one day restore His people and give them new hearts.  
Jeremiah’s life and message reveal God’s relentless love even in times of correction.

## Author  
**Jeremiah**, son of Hilkiah, a priest from Anathoth.  
He served as a prophet for over **40 years**, through the reigns of Judah’s last kings.  
His words were recorded by his scribe **Baruch** (Jeremiah 36:4).

## Era / Date  
Written around **626–580 BC**, spanning the years before, during, and after Jerusalem’s fall to Babylon in 586 BC.

## Audience  
Written to the **people of Judah**, warning them of judgment while offering hope for restoration.  
For believers today, Jeremiah reminds us that God’s Word still calls us to repentance, truth, and trust — even when culture resists it.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Judah had turned to idol worship, injustice, and political compromise.  
While false prophets promised peace, Jeremiah boldly declared that sin brings destruction.  
His message was unpopular, but his tears revealed God’s heart — not anger for anger’s sake, but grief over a people unwilling to return to Him.

## Purpose  
- To warn Judah of coming judgment for their unfaithfulness  
- To reveal God’s desire for repentance and spiritual renewal  
- To promise a new covenant built on grace, not law  
- To show that even in exile, God’s plans are for restoration  

## Genre  
**Prophetic narrative and poetry**  
Jeremiah mixes personal experience, divine vision, and heartfelt lament — showing both the prophet’s pain and God’s compassion.
