## Overview

Unlike most prophets who speak to people for God, Habakkuk speaks to God for the people.

He questions why God allows evil to go unpunished — only to learn that God will use even a wicked nation (Babylon) as His tool for judgment.

Though this is difficult to accept, Habakkuk ultimately chooses worship over worry.

The book ends with one of the most powerful declarations of faith in all Scripture: “Though the fig tree does not bud… yet I will rejoice in the Lord.”

## Author

**Habakkuk**, whose name likely means *“to embrace.”*

He served as a prophet in Judah and wrestled deeply with understanding God’s justice and timing.

## Era / Date

Written around **609–597 BC**, just before Babylon invaded Judah.

This was a time of rising corruption and fear as the nation faced coming judgment.

## Audience

Written to **the people of Judah**, but expressed as a personal dialogue between Habakkuk and God.

For believers today, it’s a timeless guide for navigating doubt, fear, and faith in confusing seasons.

## Historical / Cultural Context

Judah had grown violent and unjust under weak leadership.

The Assyrian Empire was fading, and Babylon’s power was rising fast.

Habakkuk couldn’t understand why God allowed evil within Judah to continue — and was even more shocked when God revealed He would use Babylon, an even more corrupt nation, as His instrument of discipline.

Through it all, God shows that His justice and timing are perfect, even when unseen.

## Purpose
- To show that believers can bring their honest questions to God
- To affirm that God is sovereign and just, even when life feels unfair
- To teach that faith means trusting when we can’t see the outcome
- To move us from complaint to confidence in God


## Genre

**Prophetic poetry and personal lament**

Habakkuk reads like a conversation between a troubled heart and a faithful God, ending in worship and song.
