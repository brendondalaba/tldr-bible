## Overview  
Written near the end of Solomon’s life, Ecclesiastes reads like a journal of reflection from a man who had everything — and found it empty without God.  
He explores the limits of human wisdom and the temporary nature of worldly pursuits.  
Yet woven through his observations is a call to enjoy God’s gifts and remember that eternity gives life its meaning.

## Author  
**King Solomon**, son of David, is traditionally recognized as the author (Ecclesiastes 1:1, “the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem”).  
His wisdom and wealth give weight to his conclusion that life without God leads to emptiness.

## Era / Date  
Written around **940–930 BC**, late in Solomon’s reign, after his spiritual decline and repentance.

## Audience  
Written for those seeking fulfillment in life — both the wise and the weary.  
For believers today, Ecclesiastes teaches that meaning, peace, and joy come only from walking with God, not from chasing the world.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Solomon ruled during Israel’s golden age of prosperity and peace.  
Surrounded by luxury, philosophy, and human achievement, he saw firsthand that success and comfort could never satisfy the soul.  
His reflection still speaks powerfully to a modern world full of striving but short on purpose.

## Purpose  
- To expose the emptiness of life without God  
- To teach that earthly pursuits cannot fill eternal longings  
- To encourage contentment, reverence, and gratitude toward God  
- To remind believers that judgment and eternity give life meaning  

## Genre  
**Wisdom literature and philosophical reflection**  
Ecclesiastes blends poetry, observation, and philosophy to lead readers toward eternal perspective.
