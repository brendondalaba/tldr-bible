# Hosea  
*The God Who Loves the Unfaithful*

> “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely.” — **Hosea 14:4**

Hosea’s story is a living picture of God’s love toward His people.  
Through the prophet’s painful marriage to an unfaithful wife, God reveals His own faithful heart — one that refuses to give up on those who wander away.  
Even in judgment, His mercy is still reaching out, calling His people back home.

---

## Overview  
God calls Hosea to marry **Gomer**, a woman who would be unfaithful to him.  
Their marriage becomes a symbol of Israel’s spiritual adultery — chasing idols instead of remaining loyal to God.  
Yet despite betrayal, God tells Hosea to pursue her again, showing that His love is covenantal, not conditional.  
The book moves from warning and heartbreak to forgiveness and restoration, echoing the Gospel long before Christ came.
