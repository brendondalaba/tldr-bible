## Overview

Micah served during a time of great moral decay.

While the rich oppressed the poor and justice was twisted, religion continued outwardly — but hearts were far from God.

Micah proclaimed judgment for sin and hypocrisy, yet he also foretold a future Shepherd-King who would be born in Bethlehem and bring peace to the ends of the earth.

Through it all, Micah reminds us that God’s heart is both holy and compassionate — He must judge sin, but delights in mercy.

## Author

**Micah of Moresheth**, a prophet from a small town southwest of Jerusalem.

His name means *“Who is like the Lord?”* — a fitting summary of his message.

## Era / Date

Written around **740–700 BC**, during the reigns of **Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah** — the same era as Isaiah.

Micah witnessed the fall of the northern kingdom (Israel) and warned Judah of coming judgment.

## Audience

Written to **both Israel and Judah**, confronting their leaders, priests, and people.

For believers today, Micah calls us to live justly and humbly in a world that often values power and pride over truth and compassion.

## Historical / Cultural Context

The nation was prosperous but spiritually bankrupt.

Bribery, exploitation, and false prophecy were common.

Micah’s voice cut through the noise, reminding everyone that God sees injustice — and will not ignore it.

Yet amid judgment, he announced hope: God would raise up a Ruler from Bethlehem to shepherd His people in righteousness.

## Purpose
- To warn of God’s judgment for corruption and idolatry
- To call His people to repentance and humility
- To reveal God’s plan of restoration through the coming Messiah
- To teach that true faith is expressed through justice, mercy, and humility


## Genre

**Prophetic poetry and social justice preaching**

Micah combines vivid imagery, courtroom language, and personal lament to reveal both God’s holiness and His compassion.
