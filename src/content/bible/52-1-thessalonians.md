## Overview  
The Thessalonian church was young — barely months old — when persecution forced Paul to leave the city.  
Worried about their faith, he sent Timothy to check on them, and Timothy’s good report moved Paul to write this letter.  
It’s a blend of praise, practical instruction, and hope — showing that faith flourishes even in hardship when it’s rooted in Christ.

## Author  
**The Apostle Paul**, with **Silas** and **Timothy**.  
Written during Paul’s second missionary journey, soon after planting the church.

## Era / Date  
Written around **A.D. 50–51**, likely from **Corinth** — one of Paul’s earliest letters.
