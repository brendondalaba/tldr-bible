## Overview  
1 Chronicles opens with genealogies tracing God’s faithfulness from Adam to Israel, reminding readers of their heritage in God’s story.  
The narrative then centers on David’s reign — his rise, victories, worship, and plans for the temple.  
Written to a nation recovering from exile, the message is clear: God’s promises haven’t failed, and His kingdom is built through worship and obedience.

## Author  
Written by **Ezra the priest** (according to Jewish tradition), drawing from earlier records like Samuel and Kings.  
Ezra wrote to encourage the returning exiles to rebuild their faith, identity, and worship centered on God’s presence.

## Era / Date  
Compiled around **450–430 BC**, long after Israel’s exile to Babylon.  
It looks back over Israel’s history — particularly David’s reign (about 1010–970 BC).

## Audience  
Written to the **Jews returning from exile**, reminding them that their identity is rooted in God’s covenant and presence — not political power.  
For modern readers, 1 Chronicles reminds us that God’s kingdom is built through hearts devoted to Him, not through human might.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Israel had returned from captivity to find their land in ruins and their hope fragile.  
While other nations worshiped false gods, God called His people to rebuild their lives around His temple and His Word.  
This retelling of David’s story served as a spiritual reset — reminding them that worship, not war, sustains God’s people.

## Purpose  
- To remind Israel of their covenant relationship with God  
- To highlight David’s heart for worship and God’s presence  
- To show that God’s promises still stand, even after exile  
- To point to the coming King whose reign will never end  

## Genre
