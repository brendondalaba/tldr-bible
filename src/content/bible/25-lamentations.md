## Overview  
Traditionally written by the prophet Jeremiah, Lamentations is a series of five poems describing the devastation of Jerusalem after Babylon’s invasion.  
The city that once flourished now lies in ruins.  
But even amid pain and despair, Jeremiah declares that God’s mercy has not ended — He remains faithful, even when everything else falls apart.  
It’s a book about learning to grieve rightly while trusting the God who restores.

---

## Author  
**Jeremiah**, the “weeping prophet,” is widely recognized as the author.  
He witnessed Jerusalem’s fall firsthand and poured his heart out to God in poetry and tears.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **586 BC**, immediately after the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple.

---

## Audience  
Written to the **Jewish exiles and survivors** of Jerusalem’s destruction, helping them process grief and turn back to God.  
For believers today, it offers comfort and perspective in seasons of suffering, loss, or national decline.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Jerusalem had been warned repeatedly to repent, but the people ignored God’s prophets.  
When Babylon invaded, the city was destroyed, the temple burned, and many were taken captive.  
Lamentations became Israel’s funeral song — a national cry of repentance and a confession that God’s judgment was just.  
Yet it also became a song of hope: even after devastation, God’s covenant love endures.

---

## Purpose  
- To express grief over Jerusalem’s destruction and the people’s sin  
- To teach repentance and humility before God  
- To show that hope remains even in suffering  
- To affirm God’s faithfulness and mercy despite judgment  

---

## Genre  
**Poetic lament and acrostic poetry**  
Each chapter (except the fifth) follows a Hebrew acrostic pattern — a sign of order and reflection even amid chaos.
