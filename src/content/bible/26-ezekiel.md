## Overview  
Ezekiel served as both prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile.  
His ministry began when Israel had lost everything — their land, their temple, and their hope.  
Through dramatic visions, symbolic acts, and divine messages, Ezekiel shows that God’s glory had left the temple because of sin, but one day it would return.  
He also promises a coming renewal — new hearts, a new covenant, and the Spirit’s presence dwelling among God’s people again.

## Author  
**Ezekiel**, son of Buzi, a priest taken into exile in Babylon around 597 BC.  
He began his prophetic ministry at age 30 — the same age priests began their temple service.

---

## Era / Date  
Written between **593–571 BC**, during Israel’s captivity in Babylon.  
Ezekiel’s prophecies span from the early years of exile through the fall of Jerusalem.

---

## Audience  
Written to **Jewish exiles** in Babylon who had lost hope of returning home.  
For believers today, Ezekiel reveals God’s faithfulness to restore, renew, and dwell among His people again.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
The Babylonian Empire had conquered Jerusalem and deported many Israelites.  
In exile, the people believed God had forsaken them.  
Ezekiel’s visions challenged that idea — God was not confined to the temple or to one land. His glory could move, and His Spirit could still work, even in exile.  
This message was revolutionary: **God’s presence isn’t limited by location — it’s defined by relationship.**

---

## Purpose  
- To reveal God’s holiness and sovereignty among the nations  
- To explain that exile was the result of sin, not abandonment  
- To give hope of spiritual renewal and restoration  
- To promise the coming of the Holy Spirit and a restored kingdom  

---

## Genre  
**Prophetic narrative and apocalyptic vision**  
Ezekiel combines symbolic actions, parables, and supernatural imagery to communicate God’s message with clarity and power.
