## Overview

Written to seven struggling churches in Asia Minor, Revelation brings both comfort and conviction.

It reveals Christ as the risen, reigning King — the Alpha and Omega — and warns believers not to compromise with a corrupt world.

The book moves from present reality to ultimate destiny: the defeat of evil, the return of Christ, and the renewal of creation.

It’s not a code to crack, but a call to endure, worship, and hope.

## Author

**The Apostle John**, exiled on the island of **Patmos** for preaching the Gospel, receives this revelation from Jesus.

## Era / Date

Written around **A.D. 95–96**, during the reign of Emperor Domitian — a time of intense persecution.

## Audience

Addressed to the **seven churches of Asia Minor** (modern-day Turkey): Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.

For believers today, Revelation strengthens our endurance and fuels our hope — Jesus reigns, and His kingdom will come in full.

## Historical / Cultural Context

Christians were being marginalized, imprisoned, and executed for refusing to worship the emperor.

John’s vision reminds them (and us) that the kingdoms of this world are temporary, but Christ’s rule is eternal.

Every symbol points to a deeper truth: behind earthly chaos stands the Lamb who is sovereign and victorious.

## Purpose
- To reveal Jesus Christ as the victorious Lord over history
- To encourage believers to persevere through persecution
- To warn against compromise and spiritual apathy
- To assure that evil will be judged and God’s people vindicated
- To inspire worship, endurance, and hope


## Genre
