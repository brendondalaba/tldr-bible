## Overview  
Written as a sequel to Luke’s Gospel, Acts picks up right after Jesus’ resurrection and ascension.  
It begins with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, launching the Church’s mission to make disciples of all nations.  
Through persecution, miracles, and bold preaching, the Gospel spreads — first through Peter and the apostles in Jerusalem, and then through Paul’s missionary journeys across the Roman world.  
Acts shows that when God’s people depend on His Spirit, *nothing* can stop His plan.

## Author  
**Luke**, the physician and historian who also wrote the Gospel of Luke.  
He writes as both a careful researcher and an eyewitness to many events through his travels with Paul.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **A.D. 62**, covering about 30 years of Church history — from Jesus’ ascension to Paul’s house arrest in Rome.

---

## Audience  
Addressed to **Theophilus** and to all believers — showing how the Gospel moved from local to global through the power of the Holy Spirit.  
For readers today, Acts is both history and blueprint — showing what God can do through Spirit-filled believers.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
The Roman Empire connected much of the known world through roads and trade — ideal for spreading news rapidly.  
But following Jesus also meant persecution.  
Despite opposition from governments, religions, and cultures, the Church exploded in growth, proving that the power of the Holy Spirit is unstoppable.
