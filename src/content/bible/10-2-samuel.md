## Overview  
Following Saul’s death, David becomes king and unites Israel into one kingdom.  
He defeats Israel’s enemies, brings the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, and establishes it as the nation’s capital.  
But David’s life also reveals how sin, though forgiven, still carries consequences.  
Through triumph and tragedy, 2 Samuel shows how God’s grace works even in broken lives.

## Author  
Traditionally attributed to the prophets **Nathan** and **Gad**, along with records from court scribes during David’s reign (see 1 Chronicles 29:29).  
It continues directly from the events of 1 Samuel.

## Era / Date  
Written around **970 BC**, covering roughly **40 years** — the entire reign of King David over Judah and Israel.

---

## Audience  
Written to the people of Israel to show God’s faithfulness in establishing David’s kingdom and to highlight both the blessings of obedience and the consequences of sin.  
For us today, it reminds us that even those after God’s heart need His mercy and grace every day.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
During David’s reign, Israel rose from a scattered tribal nation to a strong and united kingdom.  
Other ancient nations glorified their kings and hid their faults — but the Bible records David’s failures honestly, proving that God’s story is one of truth and redemption.  
The Davidic Covenant becomes the centerpiece of Israel’s hope — that one of David’s descendants would reign forever, fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
