## Overview  
About a century after Jonah preached to Nineveh, the Assyrian Empire had returned to violence and arrogance.  
They oppressed nations and brutalized Israel.  
Through Nahum, God declares judgment on Nineveh — the same city that once repented — and promises comfort to His people who had suffered under its cruelty.  
Nahum’s message is clear: God’s justice may seem delayed, but it is never denied.

---

## Author  
**Nahum the Elkoshite**, likely from southern Judah.  
His name means *“comfort,”* fitting for a prophet who delivered assurance that God would defend His people and destroy their oppressors.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **663–612 BC**, just before the fall of Nineveh (612 BC).  
This was during the height of Assyria’s power, when its downfall seemed impossible — yet God declared it in advance.

---

## Audience  
Addressed primarily to **Judah**, offering comfort and hope that God would soon bring justice against their enemy, **Assyria**.  
For believers today, Nahum reminds us that God is good, but He is also just — He will always make things right in His time.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Assyria was known for its unmatched cruelty — public torture, forced slavery, and mockery of conquered peoples.  
They had once repented under Jonah, but generations later, their hearts hardened again.  
Nahum’s prophecy declares that God’s patience has run its course, and Nineveh — once spared — will now fall completely.

---

## Purpose  
- To announce judgment on Nineveh for its wickedness  
- To comfort God’s people with the assurance of His justice  
- To remind all nations that pride and cruelty bring downfall  
- To reveal that God’s sovereignty rules over empires and time itself  

---

## Genre  
**Prophetic poetry and judgment oracle**  
Nahum’s writing is vivid and powerful, filled with imagery of storms, floods, and battle to describe God’s unstoppable justice.
