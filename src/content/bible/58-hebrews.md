# Hebrews  
*The God Who Is Greater Than All*

> “Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.” — **Hebrews 4:16**

Hebrews bridges the Old and New Testaments.  
It explains how everything in the Law, temple, and priesthood pointed to Jesus — who fulfills it all perfectly.  
It’s a call to maturity and endurance, urging believers not to drift back into religion or ritual, but to cling to Christ, who is better in every way.

---

## Overview  
The book of Hebrews was written to Jewish believers who were weary under persecution and tempted to return to their old religious ways.  
The writer shows them — and us — that Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God’s plan: greater than angels, Moses, priests, or sacrifices.  
He’s the anchor for our souls and the author and finisher of our faith.

---

## Author  
The author of Hebrews is unknown.  
Early Christians suggested **Paul**, **Apollos**, or **Barnabas**, but the letter itself doesn’t say.  
What’s clear is that the author was deeply familiar with Jewish Scripture and inspired by the Holy Spirit.

---

## Era / Date  
Likely written between **A.D. 60–70**, before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple.

---

## Audience  
Addressed to **Jewish Christians** facing pressure to abandon faith in Christ and return to Judaism.  
For believers today, Hebrews reminds us that Jesus is enough — and the only way to God.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Persecution and hardship made some Jewish believers long for the familiarity of temple worship and sacrifice.  
Hebrews explains that Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice replaced the entire system of priests and offerings.  
It’s both a theological masterpiece and a heartfelt plea to stand firm in faith.
