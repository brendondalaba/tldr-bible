## Overview

Corinth was a wealthy, immoral port city known for idol worship and indulgence.

The young church there struggled to break free from the culture around it.

Paul addresses real issues — factions, sexual sin, lawsuits, and confusion about marriage, food, worship, and the resurrection.

But throughout it all, his message is clear: *Christ is the foundation. Love is the standard. The cross is the center.*

## Author

**The Apostle Paul**, who founded the church in Corinth during his second missionary journey (around **A.D. 50–52**).

He wrote this letter from **Ephesus** about **A.D. 55** after hearing reports of problems and receiving questions from the believers there.

## Era / Date

Written around **A.D. 55**, during Paul’s third missionary journey.

## Audience

Addressed to the **church in Corinth**, a diverse group of believers struggling to grow in holiness and unity.

For believers today, 1 Corinthians shows that the Gospel must shape how we think, live, and treat one another.

## Historical / Cultural Context

Corinth was a center of commerce, wealth, and moral corruption — similar to modern-day big cities.

Many new believers brought cultural baggage into the church, leading to division and confusion.

Paul’s letter provides practical correction rooted in eternal truth — calling them to live by the Spirit, not the world.

## Purpose
- To correct divisions and call the church to unity in Christ
- To address moral and doctrinal issues threatening the church’s witness
- To teach the proper use of spiritual gifts and order in worship
- To affirm the truth and importance of Christ’s resurrection


## Genre

**Pastoral letter and corrective teaching**

Blends firm correction with fatherly encouragement — truth spoken in love.
