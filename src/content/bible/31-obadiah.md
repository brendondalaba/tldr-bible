# Obadiah  
*The God Who Humbles the Proud and Protects His People*

> “The day of the Lord is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you.” — **Obadiah 1:15**

Obadiah is a brief but bold prophecy about pride, betrayal, and divine justice.  
It declares that God will bring down the arrogant and lift up the humble — showing that no nation or person is beyond His reach or His care.

---

## Overview  
Obadiah’s prophecy focuses on **Edom**, a nation descended from Esau (Jacob’s brother).  
When Jerusalem was attacked, Edom stood by — even rejoicing and taking advantage of Israel’s suffering.  
Through Obadiah, God promises that Edom’s pride will lead to its downfall, while His people will one day be restored.  
The message is clear: God opposes the proud but protects the faithful.

---

## Author  
**Obadiah**, whose name means *“Servant of the Lord.”*  
Nothing else is known about him personally, but his words carry timeless truth about God’s justice and faithfulness.

---

## Era / Date  
Likely written **around 586 BC**, shortly after the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon — the same event Edom exploited for its own gain.

---

## Audience  
Written to **Edom** (for judgment) and to **Judah** (for comfort).  
For believers today, Obadiah warns against pride and reminds us that God defends His people and brings justice in His time.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Edom and Israel had a long history of tension dating back to Jacob and Esau.  
When Babylon invaded Jerusalem, Edom not only refused to help but also looted the city and attacked fleeing survivors.  
God’s response was decisive — pride would bring Edom down, but He would restore Zion and establish His kingdom forever.

---

## Purpose  
- To condemn Edom’s pride and betrayal  
- To affirm God’s justice and sovereignty over all nations  
- To comfort God’s people with the promise of restoration  
- To show that human pride always leads to downfall  

---

## Genre  
**Prophetic oracle of judgment and restoration**  
Though only one chapter, Obadiah speaks with intensity and precision — a courtroom declaration of divine justice.
