## Overview  
Taken to Babylon as a teenager, Daniel served faithfully in a pagan empire without compromising his devotion to God.  
Through trials, dreams, and divine encounters, he remained steadfast — proving that God’s wisdom and authority are greater than any earthly power.  
The second half of the book contains prophetic visions that point forward to world empires, the coming Messiah, and God’s final triumph over evil.

## Author  
**Daniel**, a Jewish exile from the royal family of Judah.  
He was educated and placed in service under Babylonian kings, later serving under the Medo-Persian Empire as well.  
His integrity and faith made him a living testimony to God’s supremacy.

## Era / Date  
Written between **605–530 BC**, covering the period from the Babylonian exile to the rise of the Persian Empire.

## Audience

For believers today, Daniel strengthens faith in God’s sovereignty and calls us to live courageously in a world that often opposes truth.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Daniel lived through the Babylonian captivity — a time when Israel had lost its temple, land, and national identity.  
While surrounded by idol worship and corruption, Daniel modeled holiness, prayer, and faithfulness in the midst of compromise.  
His prophetic visions stretched beyond his time, revealing God’s plan for future empires and the coming of the eternal kingdom through the Son of Man.

## Purpose  
- To show that God is sovereign over nations and history

## Application  
Daniel challenges us to live boldly and faithfully in a world that doesn’t honor God.  
- **Stand Firm in Conviction:** Obedience is worth more than approval.  
- **Pray Consistently:** Strength and revelation flow from communion with God.  
- **Trust God’s Sovereignty:** He rules even when the world seems out of control.  
- **Stay Pure in Babylon:** You can live in the world without becoming like it.  
- **Look Forward with Hope:** God’s kingdom will prevail — Christ reigns forever.  

> *Daniel reminds us that faith under fire refines, not destroys. The same God who shut the lions’ mouths still reigns — and His kingdom will never end.*
