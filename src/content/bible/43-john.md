# John  
*The God Who Became Flesh*

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” — **John 1:1**

The Gospel of John is the story of Jesus from heaven’s perspective.  
It reveals His divine identity as the eternal Son of God — the Word made flesh — who came to bring light, truth, and eternal life to all who believe.  
More than miracles or parables, John focuses on relationship: knowing Jesus personally as Savior, Lord, and Life itself.

---

## Overview  
John’s Gospel was written to show that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God — and that believing in Him brings eternal life (John 20:31).  
While Matthew, Mark, and Luke emphasize what Jesus *did*, John reveals who Jesus *is.*  
Through seven signs and seven “I AM” statements, John builds a case for Christ’s divinity, His love, and His mission to save the world.  
Every chapter invites readers into deeper faith — not just knowledge *about* Jesus, but relationship *with* Him.

---

## Author  
**John**, the son of Zebedee — one of Jesus’ twelve disciples and part of His inner circle.  
Known as “the disciple whom Jesus loved,” John also wrote 1–3 John and Revelation.  
He wrote late in life with deep reflection and spiritual insight.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **A.D. 85–95**, likely from **Ephesus**.  
John’s Gospel was the last to be written, offering a divine and personal perspective after the earlier Gospels.

---

## Audience  
Written for both **Jews and Gentiles**, to inspire faith in Jesus as the divine Son of God and Savior of the world.  
For believers today, John invites us to encounter Christ personally and believe fully.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
By the time John wrote, Christianity had spread widely — and false teachings were starting to question Jesus’ divinity.  
John responds by going straight to the foundation: *Jesus is God in the flesh.*  
His Gospel begins where Genesis begins — “In the beginning” — showing that Jesus is the eternal Creator and Redeemer.
