# Ephesians  
*The God Who Unites Heaven and Earth*

> “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.” — **Ephesians 2:10**

Ephesians lifts our eyes from earthly struggles to eternal realities.  
It reminds us that the Christian life starts not with what we do, but with what God has already done.  
We are blessed, chosen, forgiven, and sealed in Christ — called to walk in unity, love, and spiritual power.

---

## Overview  
Written while Paul was imprisoned in Rome, Ephesians is a circular letter meant to strengthen churches across Asia Minor.  
It’s divided into two main parts: **what God has done for us (chapters 1–3)** and **how we should live in response (chapters 4–6)**.  
Paul paints a picture of the Church as the body, bride, and temple of Christ — united under one Lord and filled with one Spirit.

---

## Author  
**The Apostle Paul**, written during his first Roman imprisonment around **A.D. 60–62**.  
It’s one of the “Prison Epistles,” along with Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **A.D. 60–62**, during Paul’s imprisonment in Rome.

---

## Audience  
Addressed to the **churches in Ephesus** and nearby regions, made up of both Jewish and Gentile believers.  
For modern readers, Ephesians reveals who we are in Christ and how to live out that identity in everyday life.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Ephesus was a major port city known for wealth, trade, and idol worship — especially the temple of Artemis.  
The Church lived amid spiritual darkness, yet Paul reminded them that Christ’s power and authority are far greater than any demonic or worldly force.

---

## Purpose  
- To remind believers of their identity and blessings in Christ  
- To call the Church to unity and maturity in love  
- To explain how grace transforms both relationships and lifestyles  
- To equip believers for spiritual warfare through God’s armor  

---

## Genre  
**Doctrinal and practical letter**  
Ephesians blends deep theology with daily application — belief and behavior intertwined.

- **Grow Up in Faith:** Maturity means becoming more like Jesus.
