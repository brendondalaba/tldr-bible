---

## Overview  
Genesis means *beginnings*. It tells how God created the world, how people turned from Him, and how He began His plan to save us. It’s the opening chapter of God’s story of redemption — how He restores what was lost.

---

## Author  
Most believe **Moses** wrote Genesis, along with the next four books of the Bible.  
He wasn’t alive for these events, but God revealed them through His Spirit and through stories passed down faithfully by God’s people.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **1440–1400 BC**, when Israel was traveling through the desert after leaving Egypt.  
The events in Genesis stretch from **Creation to the death of Joseph**, covering thousands of years.

---

## Audience  
Originally written for the Israelites — people just learning who God really is after generations in Egypt.  
Today, Genesis helps every believer understand our origin, our purpose, and God’s heart for relationship with us.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
When Genesis was written, other cultures had stories about how the world began — full of violence and many gods.  
Genesis boldly declares that there is **one good, powerful Creator** who made everything on purpose.  
The early believers (the patriarchs) lived as travelers and strangers, showing us that faith means trusting God even when we can’t see the full picture.

---

## Purpose  
- To show that **God is Creator**, in charge of everything.  
- To explain **how sin entered the world** and why life is broken.  
- To reveal **God’s rescue plan** starting with Abraham’s family.  
- To teach that **God chooses and blesses people by grace**, not because they deserve it.

---

## Genre  
Genesis is **a true story written in narrative form** — a historical account with deep spiritual meaning.  
It’s not a myth or made-up story; it’s the inspired record of how God began His relationship with humanity.

## Key Themes  

| Theme | Summary |
|-------|----------|
| **Creation** | God made everything with purpose and order. |
| **The Fall** | Sin entered through Adam and Eve and affected all creation. |
| **Judgment and Grace** | God deals with sin but always shows mercy (like with Noah). |
| **Covenant** | God makes promises to Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — and keeps them. |
| **God’s Sovereignty** | He rules over all events and uses them for His plan. |
| **Faith and Obedience** | God blesses those who trust and follow Him. |
| **Hope for a Savior** | God promises that one day someone will defeat evil forever (Genesis 3:15). |

## Structure  

### 1. The Beginning (Ch. 1–11)
- Creation  
- The Fall  
- Cain and Abel  
- The Flood  
- Tower of Babel  

### 2. The Family of Promise (Ch. 12–50)
- Abraham  
- Isaac  
- Jacob (Israel)  
- Joseph  

God’s plan starts broad with the whole world, then narrows to one family through whom He’ll bless all nations.
