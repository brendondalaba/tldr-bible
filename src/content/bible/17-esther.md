# Esther  
*The God Who Works Behind the Scenes*

> “And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?” — **Esther 4:14**

Esther tells the story of God’s unseen protection over His people during exile.  
Though His name is never mentioned in the book, His presence is everywhere — guiding events, reversing evil plans, and showing that no circumstance is beyond His control.

---

## Overview  
Set in Persia during the reign of King Xerxes (Ahasuerus), Esther follows a young Jewish woman who becomes queen.  
When a wicked official named Haman plots to destroy the Jews, Esther risks her life to stand before the king and intercede for her people.  
Through her courage and God’s providence, the Jews are saved, and their enemies are defeated.  
Esther reminds us that even when God seems silent, He’s still moving powerfully behind the scenes.

## Author  
The author is **unknown**, though Jewish tradition attributes it to **Mordecai**, Esther’s cousin and guardian.  
It was likely written soon after the events it describes, during the Persian Empire.

---

## Era / Date  
Takes place around **483–473 BC**, during King Xerxes’ reign — between the time of **Ezra 6** and **Nehemiah 7**.

---

## Audience  
Written for the **Jewish people living in exile**, to celebrate God’s deliverance and to explain the origin of the Feast of Purim.  
For believers today, Esther shows that God’s plans prevail even when He appears hidden or distant.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
The Persian Empire ruled over 127 provinces, including many Jewish exiles.  
Despite living far from Jerusalem and the temple, God’s people were still under His care.  
Persia was a world of wealth, politics, and intrigue — yet even in that environment, God placed His people in positions of influence to fulfill His purposes.

## Purpose  
- To reveal God’s providence and sovereignty even when unseen  
- To encourage courage and faithfulness in times of danger  
- To record how God preserved His people from annihilation  
- To remind believers that God positions His people with purpose

## Genre
