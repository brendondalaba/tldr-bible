# Joshua  
*The God Who Fulfills His Promises*

> “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” — **Joshua 1:9**

Joshua is the story of promise fulfilled. After forty years in the wilderness, God leads His people into the land He promised to Abraham. It’s a book about courage, faith, and obedience — and a reminder that God always keeps His word.

---

## Overview  
Joshua continues right where Deuteronomy ends. Moses has died, and Joshua is now leading Israel.  
The people finally cross the Jordan River, conquer the land of Canaan, and settle in their inheritance.  
Through every battle and victory, God shows that His promises never fail — but His blessings come through faith and obedience.

---

## Author  
**Joshua**, Moses’ successor, is traditionally believed to have written most of this book.  
It records both God’s commands and Israel’s journey into the Promised Land, with possible later additions by priests or scribes after Joshua’s death.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **1400–1370 BC**, shortly after Israel entered Canaan.  
The events span roughly **25 years**, from Joshua’s commissioning to his death.

---

## Audience  
Written to the Israelites as they began life in the Promised Land — a reminder that victory comes from trusting and obeying God.  
For today’s readers, Joshua teaches how to step into God’s promises with faith and courage.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Canaan was a land filled with idolatry, violence, and corruption.  
God commanded Israel to drive out these nations, not out of cruelty, but to preserve holiness and justice.  
The conquest of Canaan was both judgment on sin and mercy for future generations.  
Through it all, God showed His power to fulfill promises and defend His people against impossible odds.

---

## Purpose  
- To show that **God is faithful** to His promises  
- To demonstrate that **obedience brings victory**  
- To record Israel’s **inheritance and division of the land**  
- To remind believers that **God fights for those who trust Him**

---

## Genre  
**Historical narrative** with spiritual lessons of faith and courage.  
It’s both a war record and a testimony of God’s unshakable faithfulness.
