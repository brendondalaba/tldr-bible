## Overview  
Set about thirteen years after Ezra’s arrival in Jerusalem, Nehemiah follows the next stage of restoration.  
When Nehemiah hears that Jerusalem’s walls are still in ruins, he weeps, prays, and acts.  
With courage and God’s help, he leads the people to rebuild the walls in just 52 days — despite opposition.  
The book ends with revival as God’s Word is read, worship is restored, and the people renew their covenant with Him.

## Author  
Written by **Nehemiah**, the cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, later compiled and edited by **Ezra**.  
Nehemiah’s memoir-style writing gives a personal, passionate account of leadership and faith in action.

## Era / Date  
Covers roughly **445–430 BC**, during the reign of Artaxerxes I of Persia.  
It continues directly after Ezra’s ministry.

## Audience  
Written for the **Jewish community in Jerusalem** and those scattered across the empire — reminding them that God was still rebuilding His people.  
For modern readers, it’s a guide for godly leadership, perseverance, and teamwork in the face of obstacles.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Jerusalem’s walls had been torn down for over a century since Babylon’s invasion.  
Without walls, the city was defenseless and vulnerable.  
Under Persian rule, God moved in the hearts of both kings and people to restore what was lost — proving His sovereignty even over earthly powers.  
Opposition came from surrounding nations, but faith and unity overcame fear.

## Purpose  
- To show how God empowers faithful leadership to bring restoration  
- To inspire courage, prayer, and perseverance amid opposition  
- To emphasize the importance of both physical and spiritual rebuilding  
- To demonstrate that God restores His people when they return wholeheartedly to Him  

## Genre  
**Historical narrative and personal memoir**  
Nehemiah reads like a leader’s journal — practical, passionate, and centered on faith.
