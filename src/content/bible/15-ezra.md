# Ezra  
*The God Who Restores His People and Rebuilds What Was Broken*

> “The hand of the Lord my God was on me.” — **Ezra 7:28**

Ezra is a story of comeback and renewal. After decades in exile, God stirs the hearts of kings and people alike to return to Jerusalem, rebuild the temple, and restore worship.  
It’s a book about repentance, obedience, and the faithfulness of a God who always brings His people home.

---

## Overview  
Ezra picks up where 2 Chronicles ends. God moves the Persian king Cyrus to issue a decree allowing the Jews to return and rebuild the temple.  
Two main leaders emerge: **Zerubbabel**, who leads the first return and rebuilds the temple, and **Ezra**, who later leads a second group to restore God’s Word and proper worship.  
The book reminds us that spiritual renewal starts not just with construction — but with consecration.

---

## Author  
Written by **Ezra the priest and scribe**, a direct descendant of Aaron.  
He was a man deeply devoted to God’s Word, leading the people in revival through teaching and repentance.

---

## Era / Date  
Covers roughly **538–458 BC** (about 80 years).  
Written around **450 BC**, during the Persian Empire’s rule over Israel.

---

## Audience  
Written to the **Jewish exiles who returned** — to remind them that God had not abandoned His promises.  
For today’s believers, Ezra shows that restoration begins when we return to God’s presence and His Word.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
After seventy years in Babylon, the Persians conquered the Babylonians and allowed captives to return to their lands.  
Jerusalem was in ruins, and the people faced opposition, discouragement, and temptation to compromise.  
Yet God raised up faithful leaders like Zerubbabel, Haggai, and Ezra to rebuild not just the temple — but the nation’s heart for God.

---

## Purpose  
- To record God’s faithfulness in bringing His people back from exile  
- To show that true revival starts with God’s Word and repentance  
- To encourage faithfulness despite opposition  
- To remind God’s people that His covenant mercy never ends
