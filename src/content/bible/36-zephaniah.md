# Zephaniah  
*The God Who Judges to Restore*

> “The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you.” — **Zephaniah 3:17**

Zephaniah is both sobering and hopeful.  
It warns of the coming *Day of the Lord* — a time of judgment against sin and pride — but it also promises that after refining comes rejoicing.  
God’s justice makes way for joy, and His judgment clears the path for revival.

---

## Overview  
Zephaniah preached during a time of spiritual decline in Judah.  
The people had turned to idols and mixed true worship with false gods.  
Through Zephaniah, God declares that judgment is near — not only for Judah but for all nations.  
Yet the book ends in a song of restoration: God Himself rejoices over His redeemed people.  
Zephaniah reminds us that the God who disciplines is the same God who delights.

---

## Author  
**Zephaniah**, a prophet and descendant of King Hezekiah.  
His royal background gave him a unique voice in calling leaders to repentance and reform.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **640–621 BC**, during the reign of **King Josiah**, just before his spiritual reforms began.  
This was shortly before Babylon’s rise to power and Judah’s eventual fall.

---

## Audience  
Written to **Judah** and extended to **surrounding nations**, declaring that God’s justice reaches everyone.  
For believers today, Zephaniah reminds us that God’s cleansing fire leads to renewal, not ruin.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Idolatry, corruption, and moral decay filled Judah after years of compromise under previous kings.  
Zephaniah’s message prepared the way for Josiah’s revival by warning that God’s judgment was coming — but repentance could still bring mercy.  
It also looked beyond Judah’s time to the future “Day of the Lord,” when God will finally make all things right.

---

## Purpose  
- To announce coming judgment for sin and rebellion  
- To call God’s people to repentance and humility

---

## Genre  
**Prophetic poetry and apocalyptic vision**  
Zephaniah blends warning, worship, and promise — showing that judgment is not the end but the beginning of renewal.
