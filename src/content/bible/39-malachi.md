# Malachi  
*The God Who Calls Our Hearts Back*

> “Return to Me, and I will return to you,” says the Lord Almighty. — **Malachi 3:7**

Malachi closes the Old Testament with a wake-up call — not to the rebellious, but to the *religious* who have grown cold.  
It’s a book for people who go through the motions yet have lost the fire of love and reverence for God.  
Through correction and promise, God reminds His people that He still desires their hearts — and that His Messiah is coming soon.

---

## Overview  
After the temple was rebuilt and worship restored, the people of Judah drifted into complacency.  
Their sacrifices were careless, their priests were corrupt, and their marriages unfaithful.  
Through Malachi, God confronts their indifference and invites them to return to genuine devotion.  
Even as He exposes their sin, He promises hope — the coming “Messenger” who will prepare the way for the Lord Himself.  
Malachi stands as both a warning and a bridge — leading straight to the New Testament and the arrival of Jesus Christ.

## Author  
**Malachi**, whose name means *“My messenger.”*  
Some believe it may have been a title rather than a personal name, emphasizing his role as God’s final prophet before the Messiah.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **430–420 BC**, during the time of **Nehemiah**, after the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls and temple.  
This was a period of spiritual apathy despite outward religion.

---

## Audience  
Addressed to **the post-exilic Jews in Judah**, especially the priests and leaders who had grown careless in their worship.  
For believers today, Malachi reminds us that God values sincerity over ceremony and faithfulness over formality.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
The people were no longer in exile — but their hearts were distant.  
Corruption in the priesthood, broken vows in marriage, and neglect of tithes reflected a faith grown stale.  
Yet in the midst of this decline, God promises to send a forerunner (John the Baptist) and a Redeemer (Jesus Christ) who would bring ultimate purification and restoration.

---

## Purpose  
- To call God’s people back to wholehearted devotion  
- To correct empty worship and spiritual laziness  
- To reaffirm God’s covenant love and justice  
- To prepare the way for the coming Messiah  

---

## Genre  
**Prophetic discourse in dialogue form**  
Malachi uses a conversational style — God makes a statement, the people question it, and He responds with truth and correction.
