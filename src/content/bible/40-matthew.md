## Overview

Written primarily for a Jewish audience, Matthew shows that Jesus is the promised **Messiah**, the rightful **King of the Jews**, and the ultimate fulfillment of God’s covenant promises.

It connects the Old and New Testaments, quoting the prophets often to show how Jesus completed what they foretold.

Matthew also gives us the **Sermon on the Mount**, the **Great Commission**, and a vivid picture of what life looks like under the rule of King Jesus — a life marked by humility, mercy, and obedience.

## Author

**Matthew (Levi)** — a former tax collector turned disciple of Jesus.

After encountering Christ, he left his old life behind to follow Him and later recorded this Gospel under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

## Era / Date

Written between **A.D. 60–70**, likely from Antioch or Palestine.

It captures Jesus’ ministry, death, and resurrection from a distinctly Jewish perspective.

## Audience

Written for **Jewish believers and seekers**, showing that Jesus is the long-promised Messiah who fulfills the Law and the Prophets.

For modern readers, Matthew lays the foundation for understanding Jesus as King, Savior, and teacher of a new kingdom way of life.

## Historical / Cultural Context

Israel was under Roman occupation, longing for deliverance.

Many expected a political savior — but Jesus came first to deliver from sin.

Matthew’s Gospel carefully traces Jesus’ lineage, teachings, and miracles to show that He is not just a man of power, but God incarnate — Immanuel, “God with us.”
