## Overview

Sixteen years after the first exiles returned from Babylon, the rebuilding of the temple had stalled.

The people faced discouragement, opposition, and misplaced priorities.

God sends Haggai to stir their hearts: *“Consider your ways.”*

When they obey, God renews their strength, restores their joy, and fills His house with glory once again.

Haggai shows how obedience brings alignment — and alignment brings blessing.

## Author

**Haggai**, one of the post-exilic prophets alongside Zechariah and Malachi.

Little is known about him personally, but his message was brief, clear, and powerful — delivered over just four months in 520 BC.

## Era / Date

Written in **520 BC**, during the reign of **Darius I** of Persia, about 18 years after the first group of exiles returned to Jerusalem.

## Audience

Addressed to the **returned exiles in Judah**, especially the governor **Zerubbabel** and the high priest **Joshua**.

For believers today, Haggai challenges us to put God first in every area of life and to build His kingdom above our own comfort.

## Historical / Cultural Context

The temple — symbol of God’s presence — lay unfinished while the people focused on their personal prosperity.

Droughts, scarcity, and frustration set in, not by accident but by divine design.

Through Haggai, God reveals that neglecting His work leads to emptiness, but putting Him first restores everything.

## Purpose
- To call God’s people to rebuild the temple and renew their devotion
- To remind them that God’s presence is their greatest blessing
- To show that obedience brings restoration and joy
- To point ahead to a greater glory — Christ Himself


## Genre

**Prophetic exhortation and encouragement**

Haggai’s message is direct and practical, blending confrontation with comfort.
