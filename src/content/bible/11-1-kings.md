## Overview

The book opens with David’s final days and Solomon’s coronation. Under Solomon, Israel reaches its peak of wealth, peace, and influence, including the building of the temple in Jerusalem.

But as Solomon and later kings drift toward idolatry, the kingdom splits into two — Israel in the north and Judah in the south.

Through prophets like Elijah, God calls His people back, proving He is patient but also just.

## Author

Traditionally attributed to the **prophet Jeremiah** or another historian inspired by God, drawing from royal records and prophetic writings.

It continues the story from 2 Samuel and sets the stage for Israel’s later exile.

## Era / Date

Covers roughly **120 years** — from **970 BC to 850 BC**.

It records events from Solomon’s reign through the ministries of Elijah and Ahab’s rule in the north.

## Audience

Written to the Israelites during or after the kingdom’s decline as a warning and reminder: blessing comes through faithfulness; judgment follows rebellion.

For believers today, it teaches that success without obedience leads to spiritual collapse.

## Historical / Cultural Context

Israel lived among powerful nations like Egypt, Phoenicia, and Assyria, surrounded by idol worship and political intrigue.

While other kingdoms glorified their rulers, 1 Kings measures them by one standard — **their faithfulness to God**.

Even the most powerful king is accountable to the Lord of all nations.

## Purpose

1 Kings reminds us that it’s possible to start well and finish poorly — unless we keep our hearts fully devoted to God.
- **Guard Your Heart:** Wisdom fades when love for God grows cold.
- **Worship Wholeheartedly:** God deserves undivided devotion.
- **Listen to His Word:** Prophets speak truth even when it’s uncomfortable.
- **Seek God’s Wisdom Daily:** True understanding begins with reverence.
- **Stay Faithful:** God blesses integrity but opposes compromise.


> *1 Kings calls us to worship with undivided hearts and remember that lasting glory belongs only to the King whose throne will never fall — Jesus Christ.*
