## Overview

Paul had left Titus in Crete to strengthen the new believers and appoint leaders.

The churches were growing, but false teachers and cultural immorality were threatening their stability.

Paul writes to help Titus bring order — appointing elders, teaching truth, and encouraging believers to live in a way that reflects God’s grace.

This letter is practical, direct, and deeply encouraging — showing how the Gospel builds character and community.

## Author

**The Apostle Paul**, writing to **Titus**, one of his most trusted companions in ministry.

Titus was a Gentile convert and a proven leader who had served with Paul in Corinth and Crete.

## Era / Date

Written around **A.D. 63–65**, between Paul’s two Roman imprisonments.

## Audience

Addressed to **Titus** and the churches of **Crete**.

For believers today, Titus gives a model for living out the Gospel through integrity, sound teaching, and grace-filled good works.

The church there was young and easily influenced by surrounding culture.

Paul’s letter teaches how grace reforms lives from the inside out — producing people who reflect the character of Christ.
