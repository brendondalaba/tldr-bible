## Overview

Written by **James**, the half-brother of Jesus and leader of the Jerusalem church, this letter is one of the most practical in the New Testament.

It was written to Jewish believers scattered by persecution who needed to be reminded that true wisdom and maturity come from living what they believe.

James is like a mirror — showing whether our faith is genuine by how we treat others and how we respond under pressure.

## Author

**James**, the half-brother of Jesus and a respected leader in the early Church.

Known for his humility and prayer life, James was called “James the Just.”

## Era / Date

Written around **A.D. 44–49**, making it one of the earliest New Testament letters.

## Audience

Addressed to the **twelve tribes scattered among the nations** — Jewish Christians living outside Israel.

For believers today, James speaks directly to how faith works in daily life.

## Historical / Cultural Context

Early Jewish Christians faced poverty, persecution, and conflict both within and outside the church.

Many were struggling to live out their faith consistently in a divided and unjust world.

James writes to bring their faith back to action, reminding them that obedience is the true measure of belief.

- To call believers to endurance through trials
- To warn against favoritism, hypocrisy, and careless speech
