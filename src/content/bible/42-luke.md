Luke was a physician, historian, and companion of Paul.  
His Gospel focuses on Jesus’ compassion, showing how He touched the untouchable and welcomed the outcast.  
It’s also the most orderly and inclusive account — written to assure readers that the Good News is not just for one nation or class, but for everyone.  
Luke connects heaven and earth — showing the Savior who not only redeems but restores hearts, homes, and hope.

## Author  
**Luke**, a Gentile physician and careful historian.  
He also wrote the Book of Acts, making his writings the longest combined section of the New Testament.

## Historical / Cultural Context
