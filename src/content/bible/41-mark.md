# Mark  
*The Servant King in Action*

> “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” — **Mark 10:45**

Mark is the Gospel of action.  
It doesn’t dwell long on long speeches or genealogy — it moves fast, showing Jesus healing, teaching, casting out demons, and ultimately laying down His life.  
Here, we see Jesus as both the powerful **Son of God** and the humble **Servant** who came to meet humanity’s deepest need.

---

## Overview  
Mark gives us the most concise and fast-paced account of Jesus’ life.  
Written for Roman readers, it emphasizes what Jesus *did* more than what He *said*.  
Every page reveals His authority over nature, sickness, sin, and death — yet His mission is marked by humility and sacrifice.  
In the end, the One who serves becomes the One who saves.

---

## Author  
**John Mark**, a companion of Peter and Paul.  
Most scholars believe Mark’s Gospel records Peter’s eyewitness memories of Jesus’ ministry, giving it a raw, vivid tone.  
Mark’s story of redemption — once having failed on a mission trip, later restored — mirrors the message he writes: God’s grace never quits.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **A.D. 55–65**, likely in **Rome**, making it the earliest of the four Gospels.

---

## Audience  
Written for **Roman believers**, especially Gentiles, who valued strength, authority, and action.  
For believers today, Mark reminds us that Jesus is the mighty yet merciful Son of God — always moving toward people in need.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
The early church in Rome faced persecution and hardship.  
Mark’s Gospel encouraged them that Jesus, the suffering Servant, had already walked the path of sacrifice and victory before them.  
It’s the Gospel of courage under fire — a call to follow Jesus faithfully, even when it costs.

---

## Purpose  
- To present Jesus as the **Son of God** and **Servant-King**  
- To show His authority through miracles, compassion, and the cross  
- To inspire active faith that follows Jesus’ example of obedience  
- To reveal that true greatness is found in serving others  

---

## Genre  
**Gospel narrative of action and discipleship**  
Mark uses vivid detail, fast transitions (“immediately”), and emotional depth to pull readers into the story of Christ’s ministry.
