# Proverbs  
*The God Who Teaches Us How to Live Wisely*

Proverbs is God’s handbook for wise living. It turns faith into action — showing us how to think, speak, work, and relate in ways that honor God.  
It’s not about perfection but direction — walking daily in God’s wisdom rather than the world’s foolishness.
