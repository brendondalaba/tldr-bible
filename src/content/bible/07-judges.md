# Judges  
*The God Who Rescues Again and Again*

> “In those days Israel had no king; everyone did what was right in their own eyes.” — **Judges 21:25**

Judges is a sobering yet hopeful book. It shows what happens when God’s people forget Him — and how God, in mercy, keeps rescuing them anyway.  
It’s the story of a nation in cycles of sin and salvation, reminding us that God’s grace is greater than our failures.

---

## Overview  
Judges picks up after Joshua’s death. Without strong leadership, Israel drifts into disobedience and idolatry.  
God allows neighboring nations to oppress them, but when they cry out, He raises up deliverers — called “judges” — to rescue and restore them.  
The book covers roughly 300 years of Israel’s history, showing both the consequences of sin and the mercy of a God who never gives up on His people.

---

## Author  
Traditionally attributed to **Samuel**, the final judge and prophet of Israel, though the exact author is uncertain.  
It was likely written during the early monarchy, looking back on this turbulent period as a warning and lesson for future generations.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **1050 BC**, covering events from about **1375–1050 BC**, between Joshua’s death and the rise of Saul, Israel’s first king.

---

## Audience  
Written to the Israelites during the early days of their monarchy, reminding them of the dangers of forgetting God.  
For believers today, Judges shows the importance of staying faithful — and the grace of a God who restores even when we fall.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
After Joshua, Israel was a loose collection of tribes without central government or consistent leadership.  
Surrounded by Canaanite nations full of idol worship, violence, and moral corruption, Israel often blended in instead of standing apart.  
Every time they turned away from God, chaos followed — until He raised up a judge to deliver them.  
Judges shows what happens when God’s people live by their own standards instead of His.

---

## Purpose  
- To show the consequences of forgetting God  
- To reveal God’s mercy through repeated deliverance  
- To highlight the need for righteous leadership  
- To point forward to the coming King who would save His people completely

---

## Genre  
**Historical narrative** — filled with real events, real people, and deep moral lessons.  
It reads like a cycle of failure and redemption — a mirror of the human heart apart from God.
