## Overview  
Written to believers in Rome whom Paul had not yet met, this letter explains the core truths of Christianity.  
Paul walks through humanity’s problem (sin), God’s solution (Jesus), and the Spirit’s power to make us new.  
Romans answers the biggest questions: Why do we need salvation? How are we made right with God? And how should we live as a result?  
It’s not just a letter to the Romans — it’s a message for the entire Church.

## Author  
**The Apostle Paul**, formerly Saul of Tarsus — once a persecutor of Christians, now a passionate ambassador for Christ.  
He wrote Romans while in **Corinth** around **A.D. 57**.

## Era / Date  
Written around **A.D. 57**, during Paul’s third missionary journey, before his trip to Jerusalem and later imprisonment.

## Audience  
Addressed to the **believers in Rome**, a mix of Jewish and Gentile Christians learning to live out unity in the Gospel.  
For believers today, Romans grounds our faith in truth — teaching us who we are in Christ and how to live in the freedom of His grace.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Rome was the heart of the world’s power — a place of influence, diversity, and moral decay.  
The early Church there faced tension between Jewish law-keepers and Gentile believers.  
Paul writes to unite them under one truth: salvation is not through heritage or law but through Christ alone.

## Purpose  
- To clearly explain the Gospel of grace and justification by faith  
- To unite Jewish and Gentile believers under one salvation message  
- To show how grace produces holiness, not lawlessness  
- To teach how faith in Christ leads to transformed living  

## Genre  
**Theological letter and doctrinal teaching**  
Romans is both a spiritual constitution and a love letter — explaining God’s justice, mercy, and plan for all who believe.
