## Overview

After sending a strong corrective letter (1 Corinthians), Paul now writes to comfort, restore, and encourage the Corinthian believers.

He defends his ministry, shares his struggles, and reminds them that suffering for Christ produces lasting fruit.

This letter weaves themes of forgiveness, generosity, endurance, and the transforming power of the Spirit.

It’s both a pastoral letter and a personal testimony of faith through hardship.

## Author

**The Apostle Paul**, assisted by **Timothy**.

Paul wrote this letter from **Macedonia** around **A.D. 56–57**, shortly after Titus brought him news about the Corinthians’ response to his first letter.

## Era / Date

Written around **A.D. 56–57**, likely within a year of 1 Corinthians.

## Audience

Addressed to the **church in Corinth** and believers throughout **Achaia**.

For readers today, 2 Corinthians teaches that true strength is found not in appearance or success, but in surrender to God’s grace.

## Historical / Cultural Context

Paul’s authority had been challenged by false teachers who questioned his suffering and humility.

In a culture that admired wealth, eloquence, and power, Paul reminded the Corinthians that the Gospel turns those values upside down — God’s strength is made perfect in weakness.

## Purpose
- To defend Paul’s ministry and restore trust with the Corinthians
- To encourage believers to rely on God’s comfort and grace in suffering
- To teach generosity and stewardship for God’s work
- To show that weakness and hardship can glorify God


## Genre

**Personal letter of encouragement and defense**

Blends testimony, theology, and heartfelt appeal.
