# Leviticus  
*The God Who Makes Us Holy*

> “Be holy, because I, the Lord your God, am holy.” — **Leviticus 19:2**

Leviticus can seem like a hard read at first — full of rules, offerings, and rituals — but it’s actually a powerful picture of how a holy God makes a way for sinful people to live close to Him. It’s not about religion; it’s about relationship through holiness and grace.

---

## Overview  
Leviticus picks up right after Exodus. God has delivered His people from Egypt, and now He teaches them how to live as His own.  
It explains the system of sacrifices, priests, and purity laws that allowed the Israelites to worship and stay in covenant with Him.  
At its core, Leviticus shows that God is holy — and He calls His people to reflect that holiness in every part of life.

---

## Author  
**Moses** wrote Leviticus while Israel camped at Mount Sinai.  
The book records God’s direct words to Moses, giving instructions for worship, sacrifices, festivals, and daily living.

---

## Era / Date  
Written around **1440 BC**, during the Israelites’ stay at Mount Sinai, shortly after leaving Egypt.  
The events span about **one month**, focusing on God’s commands rather than travel or history.

---

## Audience  
Given to the Israelites — a newly freed people learning how to live in the presence of a holy God.  
For believers today, it reveals what it means to be set apart for God in how we live, worship, and treat others.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
In the ancient world, nations worshiped many gods through fear, superstition, and immorality.  
God’s laws in Leviticus stood out — teaching **purity, justice, compassion, and reverence**.  
While surrounding cultures used sacrifice to manipulate their gods, Israel’s sacrifices were meant to restore relationship and point to God’s mercy.  
Everything about Leviticus declared: *“Our God is holy — and He wants to be close to His people.”*

---

## Purpose  
- To show how sinful people can approach a holy God  
- To define holiness in worship, community, and daily life  
- To reveal that **atonement (forgiveness)** comes only through sacrifice  
- To set God’s people apart as different from the nations around them  

---

## Genre  
**Law and Instruction** — but deeply relational.  
Leviticus isn’t just a rulebook; it’s God’s invitation to live in His presence through purity and worship.

## Key Themes  

| Theme | Summary |
|-------|----------|
| **Holiness** | God is holy and calls His people to reflect His character. |
| **Sacrifice** | Sin separates, but sacrifice restores relationship with God. |
| **Atonement** | Forgiveness requires a substitute — pointing to Jesus. |
| **Priesthood** | God appoints mediators (priests) to stand between Him and the people. |
| **Purity** | God cares about the details of daily life — inside and out. |
| **Worship** | True worship flows from obedience and gratitude. |

---

## Structure

### 2. The Walk with God (Ch. 17–27)

## Key Verses  

| Passage | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|

| **Leviticus 19:18** | “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Later repeated by Jesus. |

## Connection to Christ  

| Foreshadow | Fulfilled in Jesus |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sacrificial System** | Jesus is the perfect sacrifice who takes away sin once for all. |
| **Priesthood** | Jesus is our eternal High Priest who intercedes for us. |
| **Day of Atonement** | Jesus’ death and resurrection bring complete forgiveness. |

## Application  
Leviticus teaches that God cares about every part of life — how we work, rest, worship, and treat others.  
- **Holiness:** Be set apart in what you do and say.  
- **Worship:** Give God your best, not leftovers.  
- **Obedience:** Holiness isn’t perfection — it’s choosing God’s way daily.  
- **Grace:** Every sacrifice pointed to Jesus, who made the way for us once and for all.  
- **Love:** Holiness shows up in how we love others well.
