## Overview  
Amos was a humble shepherd from Judah whom God sent to speak to the wealthy, self-satisfied northern kingdom of Israel.  
Though Israel prospered materially, its heart was far from God.  
Amos boldly declared that worship without justice was empty — God wanted hearts that reflected His character.  
The book ends with both warning and hope: after judgment, God promises to restore His people and bless them again.

## Author  
**Amos**, a shepherd and fig farmer from Tekoa in Judah.  
He wasn’t a professional prophet but was called by God to deliver a strong message of truth to Israel.

## Era / Date  
Written around **760–750 BC**, during the reign of **Jeroboam II** in Israel — a time of national prosperity but spiritual corruption.

## Audience  
Directed primarily to **the northern kingdom of Israel**, who enjoyed comfort and wealth but ignored justice, honesty, and humility.  
For believers today, Amos reminds us that faith without compassion and obedience is hollow.

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Israel had become complacent, enjoying luxury while oppressing the poor and ignoring God’s commands.  
Religious ceremonies continued, but the people’s hearts were cold.  
Amos exposes the gap between appearance and reality — God desires righteousness, not just religious activity.

## Purpose  
- To expose hypocrisy and social injustice  
- To call God’s people to sincere repentance  
- To show that God’s judgment is fair and inescapable  
- To remind believers that true worship includes justice and mercy  
- To reveal God’s promise of future restoration for the faithful remnant  

## Genre  
**Prophetic oracles and poetic judgment**  
Amos uses vivid imagery and straightforward rebuke to wake up a nation asleep in self-righteousness.

## Key Themes  

| Theme | Summary |
|-------|----------|
| **Justice and Righteousness** | True faith shows in how we treat others. |
| **Empty Religion** | Worship without obedience grieves God. |
| **Divine Judgment** | God holds nations accountable for sin. |
| **Humility and Repentance** | God honors those who turn from pride. |
| **Restoration and Hope** | Judgment is not the end — mercy follows repentance. |
| **God’s Sovereignty** | He rules over all nations, not just Israel. |

## Structure  

### 1. Judgment on the Nations (Ch. 1–2)
- God pronounces judgment on Israel and surrounding nations for their sins.  

### 2. Sins of Israel Exposed (Ch. 3–6)
- Condemnation of hypocrisy, greed, and injustice.

- Ends with hope: God will restore the fallen “house of David.”  

## Key Verses

|----------|----------------|
| **Amos 3:7** | God reveals His plans through His prophets — He gives warning before judgment. |

- **Live What You Believe:** True worship transforms daily life.  
- **Seek Justice:** Care for the poor, oppressed, and forgotten.
