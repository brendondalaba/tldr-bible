# Isaiah  
*The God Who Saves and Reigns Forever*

> “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” — **Isaiah 1:18**

Isaiah is a book of warning and hope — judgment for rebellion, and redemption for the repentant.  
Through vivid prophecy, Isaiah reveals the coming Messiah who will bear our sins, heal our wounds, and establish an everlasting kingdom of righteousness.

---

## Overview  
Isaiah’s ministry spanned the reigns of four kings in Judah, during a time of moral decline and political chaos.  
God called Isaiah to speak truth to a nation that had turned away — warning of judgment through Assyria and Babylon, yet offering incredible hope of restoration.  
The second half of the book overflows with promises of comfort, salvation, and the coming of Christ — the Servant, the Savior, and the King.

## Author  
**Isaiah son of Amoz**, a prophet in Jerusalem.  
He ministered for about 60 years, from roughly **740–680 BC**, during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.  
His name means *“The Lord is salvation.”*

---

## Era / Date  
Written between **740 and 680 BC**, during Judah’s decline before the Babylonian exile.  
Isaiah witnessed both national crisis and divine revelation, bridging the gap between warning and future hope.

---

## Audience  
Written to **Judah and Jerusalem**, calling them to repentance and faith in the Holy One of Israel.  
For believers today, Isaiah shows that salvation and hope come through God alone — not through power, politics, or religion.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Judah faced constant threat from Assyria and Babylon while falling deeper into idolatry and injustice.  
In that darkness, God revealed through Isaiah His ultimate plan — a coming Redeemer who would bring light to the nations and restore all things.  
Isaiah’s words still echo today as the clearest Old Testament portrait of Jesus Christ.

---

## Purpose  
- To call God’s people to repentance and holiness  
- To warn of judgment for sin and idolatry  
- To reveal God’s plan of redemption through the coming Messiah  
- To assure Israel (and all nations) that God’s promises will prevail

## Genre

Isaiah combines judgment and comfort, earthly events and eternal hope, showing God’s character and His plan for salvation.
