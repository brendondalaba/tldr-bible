# Ruth  
*The God Who Redeems and Restores*

> “Where you go, I will go, and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.” — **Ruth 1:16**

Ruth is a story of hope in hard times — a picture of God’s faithfulness when life feels empty.  
Amid the darkness of the Judges era, God shines a light through the loyalty of a young widow and His quiet plan of redemption that would lead to the coming of Christ.

---

## Overview  
The Book of Ruth takes place during the time of the Judges, when “everyone did what was right in their own eyes.”  
While the nation struggled with rebellion, one ordinary family’s story shows how God works behind the scenes — turning tragedy into blessing.  
Through Ruth, a Moabite woman, God weaves a love story of faith, kindness, and redemption that points directly to Jesus, our ultimate Redeemer.

---

## Author  
Traditionally attributed to **Samuel**, though the author is not named.  
It was likely written during the early reign of King David, Ruth’s great-grandson.

---

## Era / Date  
Events occur around **1100 BC**, during the time of the Judges.  
The book was likely written a century or two later, after David became king.

---

## Audience  
Originally written for the Israelites to remember God’s faithfulness during their darkest seasons.  
For today’s readers, Ruth shows that God can take broken stories and turn them into something beautiful — no matter how hopeless things seem.

---

## Historical / Cultural Context  
Moab and Israel were neighboring nations with tension between them.  
In ancient Israel, widows and foreigners had little security or status, making Ruth’s loyalty and courage remarkable.  
God’s law allowed land redemption through a *kinsman-redeemer* — a close relative who could restore what was lost.  
Through this system, God reveals His heart to protect the vulnerable and restore what’s been broken.

---

## Purpose  
- To show God’s providence — how He works through ordinary people  
- To highlight His compassion for the outsider and the broken  
- To reveal the concept of **redemption** through the kinsman-redeemer  
- To trace the family line leading to King David and ultimately to Jesus Christ
