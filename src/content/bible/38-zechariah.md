## Overview

Zechariah ministered alongside Haggai after the exile, encouraging God’s people to finish rebuilding the temple and renew their hope.

Through a series of visions, he shows that God’s presence is returning to dwell among them — but the promise stretches beyond Jerusalem to a future day when the Messiah will bring salvation, victory, and peace to the whole world.

Zechariah bridges the gap between the Old and New Testaments, preparing hearts for the arrival of Christ.

## Author

**Zechariah**, the son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo.

He was both a prophet and priest — combining a heart for worship with a vision for God’s kingdom.

## Era / Date

Written between **520–480 BC**, during the rebuilding of the temple after the Babylonian exile.

## Audience

Addressed to the **returned exiles in Judah**, who had grown discouraged and doubted God’s favor.

For believers today, Zechariah reminds us that God’s Spirit still empowers His people to accomplish His work and that His promises find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus.

## Historical / Cultural Context

The people of Judah had returned from Babylon but faced opposition, delay, and spiritual fatigue.

Many wondered if God still cared or if His promises had expired.

Through Zechariah’s visions, God assures them that He remembers, He restores, and His Messiah will one day reign from Jerusalem.

## Purpose
- To encourage God’s people to rebuild with renewed hope
- To reveal God’s plans for Israel’s future restoration
- To prophesy the coming of the Messiah and His eternal kingdom
- To show that God’s Spirit, not human strength, accomplishes His will


## Genre

**Prophetic vision and apocalyptic symbolism**

Zechariah combines vivid dreams, angelic encounters, and direct Messianic prophecy, blending encouragement with revelation.
